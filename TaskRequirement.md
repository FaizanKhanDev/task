Before running this project, please ensure you have thoroughly reviewed both the project files and the README.md file. The README provides detailed instructions on how to set up and run the project.

This project has been developed strictly according to the task requirements. However, one key feature—real-time updates—has not been implemented at this stage. The reason for this is that real-time functionality requires additional development time.

That being said, the existing code should give you a clear insight into the quality and caliber of my work. I have focused on writing structured, scalable, and maintainable code that adheres to best practices.

If you have any questions or require further clarification, feel free to reach out.
